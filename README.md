# burger

Eat da burger app is testing my knowledge of mysql.  The app takes in data from the user input in the text box at the bottom once the Add Burger button is clicked.  The user input is put into a list to the left of the page.  When the user clicks the devour button the burger name is moved to a left on the right side of the page.
